</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE friendship of Nicholas Ferrar, the head
of the remarkable household at Little Gidding,
and of the saintly George Herbert, is a
pleasant episode of seventeenth century history.
One of its results was the appearance at
Cambridge in 1634 of a little volume, entitled
“Hygiasticon.” This contains a translation,
believed to be by Ferrar, of the treatise on dietetics by the learned
Jesuit, Leonard Lessius, George Herbert’s version of Luigi
Cornaro’s book on Long Life, and “A discourse translated out of
Italian that a spare diet is better than a splendid and sumptuous.”
This version was made by one whose initials, T.S., have not been
deciphered. The name of the original author was equally unknown
to bibliographers. It is, in fact, the twenty-fourth of the
“Paradossi” printed at Lyons in 1543. This book, although it has
no author’s name attached, is known to be the production of
Ortensio Lando, sometimes known by his Latin name of Hortensius
Tranquillus. He was born at Milan about the end of the
fifteenth century, and died at Venice about 1553. He was a graduate
in medicine of the University of Bologna, and for years led the life
of a wandering scholar, but finally settled at Venice where he died.
He was the author of fifty or more books.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This seventeenth century
version of Lando’s paradox whilst not slavish, makes an excellent
presentation of the spirit and aim of the original. In the few
places where the English writer has amplified the additional
matter is noteworthy. It has, therefore, been thought sufficient to
modernise the spelling, modify the arrangement and punctuation,
and substitute here and there a modern word for one that sounded less
crude in the seventeenth than in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>When a scholar, such as Ortensio Lando was, undertakes to
defend paradoxes he is not always to be taken too seriously, but
in this praise of frugal life and simple diet there is an accent of
sincerity that carries conviction.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THAT A SPARE DIET IS BETTER THAN A SPLENDID<br />
AND SUMPTUOUS—A PARADOX.</h2>
</div>


<p>I verily believe, however I have titled this opinion, yet it will by no
means be allowed for a Paradox by a number of those, whose judgement
ought to bear the greatest sway. And, to speak freely, it would seem to
me very uncouth, that any man that makes a profession of more understanding
than a beast, should open his mouth to the contrary, or make
any scruple at all of readily subscribing to the truth and evidence of this
position, that a frugal and simple diet is much better than a full and
dainty.</p>

<p>Tell me, you that seem to demur on the business, whether a sober and
austere diet serves not, without further help, to chase away that racking
humour of the gout, which by all other helps that can be used, scarce
receives any mitigation at all; but, do what can be done, lies tormenting
the body, till it have spent itself. Tell me whether this holy medicine
serve not to the driving away of headache, to the cure of dizziness, to the
stopping of rheums, to the stay of flukes, to the getting away
of loathsome diseases, to the freedom from dishonest belchings, to the
prevention of agues, and, in a word, to the clearing and draining of all
ill humours whatsoever in the body. Nor do the benefits thereof stay
only in the body, but ascend likewise to the perfecting of the soul itself:
for how manifest is it, that through a sober and strict diet, the mind and
all the faculties thereof become waking, quick, and cheerful, how is the
wit sharpened, the understanding solidated, the affections tempered, and,
in a word, the whole soul and spirit of a man freed from encumbrances,
and made apt and expedite for the apprehension of wisdom, and the embracement
of virtue?</p>

<p>The ancient sages, were, I am sure, of this opinion; and Plato in
particular made notable remonstrance of it; when upon his coming into
Sicily from Athens, he did so bitterly condemn the Syracusian tables,
which being furnished with precious and dainty cates, provoking sauces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and rich wines, sent away their guests twice a day full of good
cheer. But what wouldst thou have said, oh, Plato! if thou hadst perhaps
lighted upon such as we Christians nowadays are; amongst whom, he
that eats but two good meals a day, as we term them, boasts himself, and,
is applauded by others for a person of great temperance and singular
good diet?</p>

<p>Undoubtly, our extravagance in this matter, having added prologues of
breakfasts, interludes of banquets, epilogues of rere-suppers to the
comedy would have caused thee to turn thy divine eloquence to the
praise of those Syracusion gluttons, which, in respect of our usages and
customs, might seem great masters of temperance.</p>

<p>Nay, very Epicurus himself, however, he may thank Tully’s slanders,
his name is become in this regard so infamous, yet placed his chief delight
this way in no greater dainties than savoury herbs, and fresh cheese.</p>

<p>But I would fain once understand from these gluttons, that seem
born only to waste good meat, what the reason may be, that nowadays
the store of victuals is so much abated, and the price enhanced of that it
was in time of old, when yet the world appears to have been then much
fuller of people than it now is? Undoubtedly, that scarcity and dearness
under which we labour, can proceed from nothing but our excessive
gluttony which devours things faster than Nature can bring them forth.
And that plenty and cheapness, which crowned their happy days, was
maintained and kept on foot chiefly through the good husbandry of that
frugal and simple diet which they used.</p>

<p>S. Jerome, writing of the course of life held by those good fathers that retired
themselves into the deserts of Egypt, the better to serve God, tells
us, that they were so enamoured of spare and simple diet, that they
censured it in themselves for a kind of riot, to feed on anything that was
dressed with fire. The same in every point doth Cassian report, in his
relations of the holy monks and hermits of his time.</p>

<p>I find in ancient physicians, that the inhabitants of the old world were
such strict followers of sobriety, that they kept themselves precisely to
bread in the morning; and at night they made their supper of flesh only
without addition of sauces, or any first or second courses. And by this
means it came to pass, that they lived so long and in continual health without
so much as once hearing the names of those many grievous infirmities
that nowadays vex mankind.</p>

<p>What think you might be the cause, that the Romans, the Arcadians,
and the Portugals passed so many hundred of years, without having any
acquaintance at all with physic or physicians? Surely nothing else but
their sober spare diet, which when all is done, we are ofttimes constrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
to undergo, and ever indeed directed and advised unto, by those
who really practise this divine science of physic, for the recovery and
conservation of their patient’s health, and not covetously for their own
gain. I read in approved histories, that Ptolemy, upon some occasion or
other out-riding his followers in Egypt, was so pressed with hunger, that
he was fain to call in at a poor man’s cottage, who brought him a piece of
rye-bread; which when he had eaten, he took a solemn oath, that he
never in all his life tasted better, nor more pleasing meat: and from that
day forward, he set light by all the costly sorts of bread, which he had
been formerly accustomed unto.</p>

<p>The Thracian women, that they might bear healthful, strong, and
hardy children, ate nothing but milk and nettles, and the greatest dainties
that the Lacedemonians had amongst them, was a certain kind of black
pottage, that looked no better than melted pitch, and could not by computation
stand in above three half-pence a gallon at the most. The Persians,
that in their time were the best disciplined people on the earth, ate a
little Nasturtium<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> with their bread; and that was all the victuals that
this brave nation used, when they made conquest of the world.</p>

<p>Artaxerxes, the brother of Cyrus, being overthrown in battle, was constrained
in his flight to sit down with dry figs and barley-bread which
upon proof he found so good, as he seriously lamented his misfortune, in
having,—through the continual cloying of artificial dainties, wherewith
he had been bred up,—been so long time a stranger to that great pleasure
and delight, which natural and simple food yields, when it meets with true
hunger.</p>

<p>True it is, our stomach is a troublesome creditor, and ofttimes shamelessly
exacts more than its due: but undoubtedly, if we were not partial,
and corrupted by the allurements of that base content which dainties
promise, we might easily quiet the grudgings and murmurings thereof.
It’s not the stomach, I wis, which would rest apayed with that which is
at hand; but the satisfaction of our capricious fancies, that makes us
wear out our selves, and weary all the world besides with uncessant
travel in the search of rarities, and in the compounding of new delicacies.
If we were but half as wise as we ought to be, there need none of all this
ado that we make, about this and that kind of Manchet, Dutch-bread, and
French-bread: and I know not what new inventions are brought on foot,
to make more business in the world; whereas with much less cost and
trouble we might be much better served with that which grows at home,
and is to be found ready in every thatched cottage. That which is most
our own, and that which we therefore perhaps, fools as we be, most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
contemn in this kind,—barley-bread I mean,—is by all the old physicians,
warranted for a most sound and healthful food. He that eats daily of it,
say they, shall undoubtedly never be troubled with the gout in the feet.</p>

<p>Shew me such a virtue in any of these new inventions, and I’ll yield
there were some reason perhaps in making use of them, if they might with
ease and quiet be procured. But to buy them at the price of so much
pains, time, and hazard as they cost us, undoubtedly too much, although
they brought as much benefit as they do prejudice. Consider well, I pray,
whether it be not a thing to make a wise man run beside himself, to see
such a ransacking of all the elements by fishers and fowlers, and hunters; such
a turmoiling of the world by cooks and comfit-makers, and tavern-keepers
and a numberless many of such needless occupations; such a hazarding of
mens lives on sea and land, by heat and cold, and a thousand other
dangers and difficulties; and all forsooth in procuring dainties for the
satisfaction of a greedy maw, and senseless stomach, that within
a very short while after must of necessity make a banquet of itself to
worms.</p>

<p>What an endless maze of error, what an intolerable hell of torments
and afflictions hath this wicked gluttony brought the world unto. And yet,
wretched men that we are, we have no mind to get out of it, but like
silly animals led by the chaps, go on all day long, digging our graves with
our teeth, till at last we bring the earth over our heads much before we
otherwise need to have done. And yet there was a certain odd fellow once in
the world, I would there were not too many of the same mind nowadays!
Philoxenus by name, that seriously wished he might have a swallow as
long and as large as the cranes, the better to enjoy the full relish of his
licorish morsels. Long after him, I read of another of the same fraternity,
Apicius, I trow, that set all his happiness in good cheer: but little credit, I
am sure, he hath got by the means; no more than Maximinus, for all he
was an Emperor, by his using every meal to stuff into his paunch thirty pounds
of flesh, beside bread and wine to boot. But Geta deserves, in my opinion,
the monarchy of gluttons, as he had of the Romans. His feasts went alway
according to the letters of the alphabet, as when P’s turn came, he would
have plovers, and partridges, and peacocks, and the like; and so in all the
rest, his table was always furnished with meats whose names began with
one and the same letter.</p>

<p>But what do I raking up this carrion? Let them rot in their
corruption and lie more covered over with infamy than with earth.
Only, to give the world notice who have been the great masters of this
worthy science of filling the stomach and following good cheer, I have
been enforced to make this remembrance of some of their goodly opinions
and pranks. Which let who so will be their partner in: for my part, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
solemnly avow, that I find no greater misery than to victual the camp,
as the proverb is, cramming in lustily over night, and to be bound next
morning to rise early and to go about serious business.</p>

<p>Oh what a piece of purgatory is it, to feel within a man’s self those
qualms, those gripings, those swimmings, and those flashing heats that
follow upon over-eating! And what a shame, if our foreheads were not
of brass, and our friends before whom we act them, infected with the
same disease, would it be to stand yawning, stretching, and perbreaking
the crudities of the former day’s surfeit!</p>

<p>On the contrary, what a happiness do I prove, when after a sober
pittance I find sound and quiet sleep all night long, and at peep of day
get up as fresh as the morning itself, full of vigour and activity both in
mind and body, for all manner of affairs! Let who will take his pleasure
in the fulness of delicates; I desire my part may be in this happy
enjoyment of my self, although it should be with the abatement of much
more content than any dainties can afford.</p>

<p>When I was last at Messina, my lord Antonio Doria, told me that he
was acquainted in Spain with an old man who had lived above a hundred
years. One day having invited him home and entertained him
sumptuously, as his lordship’s manner is, the good old man instead of
thanks told him, “<i>My lord, had I been accustomed to these kind of meals in
my youth, I had never come to this age which you see, nor been able to preserve
that health and strength both of mind and body, which you make shew so much
to admire in me.</i>”</p>

<p>See now! here’s a proof even in our age, that the length and happiness
of men’s lives in the old world was chiefly caused by the means of
blessed temperance. But what need more words in a matter as evident
as the sun at noonday, to all but those whose brains are sunk down into
the quagmire of their stomachs? I’ll make an end with that which cannot
be denied, nor deluded, nor resisted; so plain is the truth, and so
great is the authority of the argument; and this it is: Peruse all
histories of whatever times and people, and you shall always find the
haters of a sober life and spare diet to have been sworn enemies against
goodness and virtue: witness Claudius, Caligula, Heliogabalus, Clodius
the tragedian, Vitellius, Verus, Tiberius, and the like. And on the
contrary, the friends and followers of sobriety and frugality to have been
men of divine spirits, and most heroical performances for the benefit of
mankind; such as were Augustus, Alexander Severus, Paulus
Æmilius, Epaminondas, Socrates, and all the rest who are registered for
excellent in the lists of princes, soldiers and philosophers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>A spare diet then is better than a splendid and sumptuous, let the
Sardanapaluses of our age prattle what they list. Nature, and reason,
and experience, and the example of all virtuous persons prove it to be so.
He that goes about to persuade me otherwise shall lose his labour, though
he had his tongue and brain furnished with all the sophistry and
eloquence that ever Greece and Italy could jointly have afforded.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
